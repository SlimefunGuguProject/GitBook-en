# What is Bump?

Bump is a Slimefun4 addon that adds magic weapons, food and an appraisal system.



Bump was published on mcbbs in 2020 by bxx2004.

In 2022, ybw0014 and haiman233 refactored Bump based on Slimefun RC-30. With the localization service, Bump is available not in Chinese only, but in more languages at Crowdin.
